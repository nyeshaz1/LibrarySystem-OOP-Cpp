# LibrarySystem-OOP-Cpp

A **C++ project** simulating a simple Library system. The program demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts by creating book objects, automatically assigning book IDs, and tracking the total number of books in the library.

  - Genre of the book

- **Static variable** `totalbooks` to track total number of books created.
- **Parameterized constructor** with **initializer list** to:
